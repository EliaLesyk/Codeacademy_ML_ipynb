This function should take two parameters &mdash;  the `test_labels` and your `predictions`. Print the results. This prints the percentage of tweets in the test set that the classifier correctly classified.\n",

The classifier predicts tweets that were actually from New York as either New York tweets or London tweets, but almost never Paris tweets.

Tweets coming from two English speaking countries are harder to distinguish than tweets in different languages.\n",
